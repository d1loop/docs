# Local web app

How to locally set up the web app.

### Forking the app

First of all, you'll need to fork the app repository. Before that, let's make sure you have:
- Git
- Node.js
- NPM (comes with the default installtion of Node)

You can use other package manager if you want to.

:::caution

Please make sure to install any necessary tools from the list above (if you are missing one of them) before proceeding with the following steps.

:::

1. Run: 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/d1loop/app.git
```
2. Navigate to the cloned directory:
```bash
cd app
```
3. Install required modules:
```bash
npm install
```

### Configuration
To make the web app working, we will need to configure some ENV values.

To do that, we need to create a new file called `.env`. We can do that using (on Mac or Linux):
```bash
touch .env
```
Or you can just create the file in the current directory (on Windows).

Now, you'll need to go to Firebase, create a project and when you select the platform of your app choose web,
and enable the following options in your Firebase project:
- Authentication: This enables the Google sign-in method for the app.
- Cloud Firestore: The database we will be using.
- Cloud Storage: The storage bucket for the images.

After that, open the file with your code editor (or through the terminal), and set the following keys:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_KEY=The pubilc API key is here
NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH_DOMAIN=The pubilc auth domain
NEXT_PUBLIC_PROJECT_ID=The public project ID
NEXT_PUBLIC_STORAGE_BUCKET=The public storage bucket
NEXT_PUBLIC_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=The public message sender ID
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_ID=The public app ID
NEXT_PUBLIC_MEASUREMENT_ID=The public measurement ID
```
Set these keys based on the configuration you got in the Firebase. To find your configuration you can go to 
Project overview > Settings icon > Project settings > And scroll down to the part of the web app.

After this configuration, you will need to run:
```bash
npm i -g firebase-tools
```
When this is installed, run:
```bash
firebase login
```
And complete the login through the pop-up window.

Now, run this command:
```bash
firebase projects:list
```
And find the project ID of the current project. Once found, run this command:
```bash
firebase use your-project-id
```
And replace the "your-project-id" with the project ID. Now, run this command:
```bash
firebase deploy --except functions
```
And you will finish the setup of the database.

Once all that done, run this command:
```bash
npm run dev
```
and you can enter the web app locally using "localhost" in your browser.
