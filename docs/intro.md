# Intro
Welcome to the official documentation for d1loop - a social networking web-app.

## ðŸ‘€ What's changed

- TL;DR:
  - d1loop is no longer an anonymous platform
  - We moved from MongoDB to Firebase and Firebase Storage
  - Comments, loops, and more was added.

As you can see here, and in the Github repository, there are changes to a lot of features of the platform (for those that compare the beta app to the current web-app) and changed to the wiki.

The reason for all of that is because I worked a lot of the brand new version that was very hard to code, but I managed to complete it. Through the coding, I found out I just couldn't make the platform anonymous anymore, which was very disappointing for me because this was the main goal of this platform.

Anyways, I still continued to complete the version, while trying to make the UI looks similar to Twitter, which I think I did pretty well.

In the new update, I found out it will be a lot easier to code a Nextjs app and not a React Native one because of it's many limitations and errors, and it was faster to code it after that.

There are features similar to Twitter (and Thread), which are commenting, looping (reposting), and likes.
I am still working on a search feature and more things like bookmarks, so there are things to wait for.

## Overview
d1loop is a mobile app designed to be the normal version of Twitter and it's similarities, without their long regisering-proccesses or required payment to view posts, and completely for free without any ads.

## Features
- **Open-source**: d1loop's code is available on Github.
- **Familiar UI\UX**: d1loop's UX\UI is designed very similar to Twitter's so it's very easily to get started.
- **Your @handler, username, profile picture and banner**: You can set all of these in your settings.

## Installation

Because we now have a web-app and not a mobile app, no need to install anything!

Just [go to d1loop](https://d1loop.vercel.app) and start using it.

:::note

If you are curious, in the next update I will add the option to install the website as an app through your mobile browser or desktop browser.
